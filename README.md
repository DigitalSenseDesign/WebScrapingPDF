# XChange-Tracker

Flask based Exchange Doccumentation Tracker

This is a flask based web interface which allows a user to register their interest in PDFs by providing the website. These PDFs are 
tracked and once daily a check is run to test whether or not they have been changed. If the file has been changed the date of the 
change is recorded and displayed.
